# Auto-remove branch links on GitHub branch deletion

When a GitHub branch linked to an Azure DevOps work item is deleted, the branch link will now be automatically removed from the work item. This feature helps keep your work items clean and up-to-date by ensuring that obsolete branch links do not clutter the work item details. This automation reduces manual effort and minimizes the risk of confusion caused by outdated branch references.
