We're adding a clear, direct entry point to help you quickly navigate to the corresponding test plan without extra steps. This improvement makes it faster and more intuitive to trace your test plans, ensuring a smoother experience when managing your test workflow.

### Azure Test Plans bug fixes

With this sprint, we’ve made updates to Azure Test Plans to resolve several bugs and improve usability. Here’s what’s been fixed:

* Fixed an issue where Test Suites did not update correctly when switching between Test Plans. 

* Fixed an issue in the Test & Feedback Extension where session reports failed to download and redirected users to a blank page.

* Fixed an issue in the new Boards hub where Shared Steps opened in the old work item form and users couldn't delete comments in the discussion section.

* Fixed an issue where filtering test results by the Owner clause did not work, causing queries to return an error instead of results.

### Export test cases with custom columns in XLSX

Now export test cases with custom columns in XLSX. Based on your feedback, Test Plans supports exporting test cases with custom columns, giving you greater flexibility and control over the data you share and analyze. This enhancement helps you tailor exports to your needs, ensuring the information you export is relevant and actionable.

### Auto-pause manual test case run

Never lose progress on your test runs with auto-pause test case run. This new feature automatically pauses your test case run if your work is interrupted, ensuring that partial progress is saved without needing a manual pause. Whether you step away or close the session, you can easily resume your test case right where you left off, reducing the risk of data loss and improving your workflow. By simplifying the pause and resume process, auto-pause helps you stay focused on testing without worrying about losing your progress.
