### Azure Test Plans bug fixes

With this sprint, we’ve made updates to Azure Test Plans to resolve several bugs and improve usability. Here’s what’s been fixed:

    Fixed a bug where shared step results wouldn’t appear in the query editor when accessing test cases in the New Boards Hub.

* **Improved stakeholder mode sessions:**
    Resolved an issue in the test and feedback extension that blocked users with stakeholder access from starting sessions. 
* **Cleaner test plan copying:**
    Fixed a problem where requirements were duplicated when copying a Test Plan using the “Reference Existing Test Cases” option.

### Export test cases with custom columns in XLSX

Now export test cases with custom columns in XLSX. Based on your feedback, Test Plans supports exporting test cases with custom columns, giving you greater flexibility and control over the data you share and analyze. This enhancement helps you tailor exports to your needs, ensuring the information you export is relevant and actionable.

### Auto-pause manual test case run
Never lose progress on your test runs with auto-pause test case run. This new feature automatically pauses your test case run if your work is interrupted, ensuring that partial progress is saved without needing a manual pause. Whether you step away or close the session, you can easily resume your test case right where you left off, reducing the risk of data loss and improving your workflow. By simplifying the pause and resume process, auto-pause helps you stay focused on testing without worrying about losing your progress.
