### GitHub Integration: Build Links for YAML Pipelines

We're committed to achieving feature parity between YAML and Classic Pipelines. One key missing feature was the ability to provide an "Integrated in build" link when your repository is hosted in GitHub. With our latest release, we've addressed this gap by adding an option in YAML pipeline settings for you to check:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> [![Screenshot of automatically link work items.](../../media/252-boards-01.png "Screenshot of automatically link work items")](../../media/252-boards-01.png#lightbox)

Once the build is complete, the corresponding link will automatically appear on the associated work items, improving the overall traceability story.
