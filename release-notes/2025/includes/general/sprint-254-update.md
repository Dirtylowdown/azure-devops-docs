### No new Azure DevOps OAuth apps beginning April 2025


As of April 2025, we will no longer accept new registrations of Azure DevOps OAuth apps. This is the first step we’ll be taking towards our longer-term vision of sunsetting the Azure DevOps OAuth platform. Moving forward, we’ll be publicly advocating all developers that are building applications on top of Azure DevOps REST APIs to [explore the Microsoft Identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview) and [registering a new Entra application](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate%2Cexpose-a-web-api) instead.

All existing Azure DevOps OAuth apps will continue working until the official end-of-life date in 2026. Learn more in [our blog post here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/no-new-azure-devops-oauth-apps-beginning-february-2025/).
