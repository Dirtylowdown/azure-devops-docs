# Azure Boards streamlines workflows with automatic build links and Azure DevOps basic access with GitHub Enterprise


With this update, Azure Boards delivers a more seamless experience with key improvements. Build links in YAML pipelines now automatically connect completed builds to work items, making it easier to track progress. Additionally, the New Boards Hub is becoming the default experience, offering a more consistent and efficient way to manage work.

We're also excited to announce that GitHub Enterprise users now have access to Azure DevOps Basic usage rights at no extra cost. By signing in to both products with your Entra ID, you can utilize this functionality. Many have already benefited from this integration!
