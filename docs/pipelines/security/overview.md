# Securing Azure Pipelines

[!INCLUDE [version-gt-eq-2020](../../includes/version-gt-eq-2020.md)]

Pipelines offer powerful capabilities for executing scripts and deploying code to production environments, but it's crucial to balance this power with security. You never want a pipeline to become a conduit for malicious code. Balancing security with the flexibility and power needed by development teams is essential.

Traditionally, organizations enforce security through strict lock-downs. Code, pipelines, and production environments face severe access restrictions. While this approach works well in small organizations with limited users and projects, larger organizations face a different reality. With numerous contributors having access to code, the principle of 'assume breach' becomes crucial. It involves operating as if an adversary possesses contributor access to repositories, necessitating heightened vigilance.

This article provides an overview of necessary security-related configurations to protect your pipelines against threats and vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

| **Product** | **Requirements**   |
|---|---|
| **Azure DevOps** | - Implement recommendations in [Secure your Azure DevOps](../../organizations/security/security-overview.md).  <br>  - Basic knowledge of YAML and Azure Pipelines. For more information, see [Create your first pipeline](../create-first-pipeline.md). <br> - **Permissions:**<br>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To modify pipelines permissions: Member of the [Project Administrators group](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- To modify organization permissions: Member of the [Project Collection Administrators group](../../organizations/security/change-project-level-permissions.md). |


## Control access

Isolate pipelines to prevent lateral movement within your organizationâ€™s projects and repositories.

- **Restrict repository and resources access**: Limit access to only the necessary repositories and resources for each pipeline.
- **Set up activity alerts**: Monitor pipeline activity and set up alerts for suspicious behavior.
- **Review activity**: Regularly review and update permissions to minimize exposure.

## Use YAML pipelines instead of Classic pipelines

For added security and to reduce the risk of accidental misconfigurations, use YAML pipelines instead of Classic pipelines. This precaution prevents a security concern arising from YAML and classic pipelines sharing the same resources, such as service connections. If your organization is using Classic pipelines, migrate the pipelines to YAML. 

- **YAML offers the benefits of infrastructure as code**: You can treat YAML pipelines like any other code because steps and dependencies are defined in code. There is also clear visibility into pipeline configurations and a reduced risk of accidental misconfigurations. 
- **YAML pipelines can be combined with enhanced security measures**: Through code reviews and pull requests, you can use [branch policies](../../repos/git/branch-policies-overview.md) to set up a review process for  pull requests to prevent bad merges. 
- **Resource access management**:  Resource owners control whether a YAML pipeline can access specific resources.  This security feature prevents attacks like [stealing another repository](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/pipeline-stealing-another-repo/). You can use [Approvals and checks](../process/approvals.md) provide access control for each pipeline run.

### Disable Creation of Classic pipelines

Independently disable the creation of classic build pipelines and classic release pipelines. When both are disabled, no classic build pipeline, classic release pipeline, task groups, or deployment groups can be created via the user interface or the REST API.

To disable the creation of classic pipelines, go to your **Organization settings** or **Project settings**, then under the *Pipelines* section select **Settings**. In the *General* section, toggle on **Disable creation of classic build pipelines** and **Disable creation of classic release pipelines**.

If you enable this feature at the organization level, it applies to all projects within that organization. However, if you leave it disabled, you can selectively enable it for specific projects.

To improve the security of newly created organizations, starting with [Sprint 226](/azure/devops/release-notes/2023/sprint-225-update#disable-creation-of-classic-pipelines-for-new-organizations-pre-announcement), by default we disable creating classic build and release pipelines for new organizations.

## Prevent Malicious code execution

To ensure that only tested and sanitized code runs through your pipeline, regularly review your pipelines for common issues. 

- **Code scanning**:  Escape special characters in arguments to avoid shell command injection. You can use GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps to automate code scanning. 
- **Validate inputs and use parameters**: Validate input parameters and arguments to prevent unintended behavior. Use parameterized queries in scripts to prevent SQL injection. [Runtime parameters](../process/runtime-parameters.md) help avoid security issues related to variables, such as [Argument Injection](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/pipeline-argument-injection/).
- **Limit permissions**: Limit permissions for pipeline service connections.


### Secure inputs

Securely use variables and parameters in your pipelines by following best practices for setting secrets, using queue-time variables, and enabling shell task argument validation to protect your pipeline from threats and vulnerabilities.

- **Restrict access to secrets**: Remove any secrets or keys from appearing in pipelines. Move to secretless authentication methods like workload identity federation or set secrets in the UI, a variable group, or a variable group sourced from Azure Key Vault.
- **Enable shell parameter validation**:  When the setting *Enable shell tasks arguments parameter validation* is enabled, there's an added check for characters like semi-colons, quotes, and parentheses. Turn on *Enable shell tasks arguments parameter validation* at the organization or project level under **Settings** > **Pipelines** > **Settings**. 
- **Limit variables that can be set at queue time**: Prevent users from defining new variables at queue time by enabling the setting *limit variables that can be set at queue time* at **Organization settings** > **Pipelines** > **Settings**. 
- **Use parameters instead of variables**: Unlike variables, a running pipeline can't modify pipeline parameters. Parameters have data types such as `number` and `string`, and they can be restricted to specific value subsets. This restriction is valuable when a user-configurable aspect of the pipeline should only accept values from a predefined list, ensuring that the pipeline doesn't accept arbitrary data.


### Begin with a Minimal Template

Begin with a minimal template and gradually enforce extensions. This approach ensures that as you implement security practices, you have a centralized starting point that covers all pipelines.

For more information, see [Templates](templates.md).
