> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Deleting **Area Paths** or reconfiguring **Iteration Paths** causes irreversible data loss. For example:
>   - Burndown and burnup widget charts
>   - Sprint burndown charts
>   - Velocity charts for teams with changed **Area Paths**
>   - Historical trend charts reference the **Area Path** and **Iteration Path** as they were defined at the time for each work item.
> - Once deleted, you can't retrieve historical data for these paths.
> - You can only delete area and iteration paths that are no longer used by any work items.
